How to Create a Package
- Create a Directory: Start by creating a directory for your package.
- Add Python Modules: Place Python .py files (modules) inside the directory.
- Create an __init__.py file: This file marks the directory as a package.
It can be empty, but it allows Python to treat the directory as a package.
